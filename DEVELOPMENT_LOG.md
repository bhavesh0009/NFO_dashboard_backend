### Phase 2: Data Extraction (Current)

- [x] Implement token values (master stock records) extraction
- [x] Create data validation schemas
- [x] Optimize token storage with unified schema
- [ ] Fetch and organize market data
- [ ] Add data transformation utilities

### Phase 3: DuckDB Integration

- [x] Setup DuckDB connection and schema
- [x] Create data storage routines
- [x] Implement unified token storage
- [ ] Implement incremental data updates
- [ ] Add data versioning capabilities

### Phase 4: Pipeline Automation

- [ ] Build automated data refresh process
- [ ] Add scheduling capabilities
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create alert system for failures

## Current Sprint Tasks

1. Fix refreshToken parameter issue in getProfile() method
2. Complete token values extraction functionality
3. Begin designing DuckDB schema for token storage
